1. Keya Bhattacharjee
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. In this module, we learnt about the different types of data, how to source the data and how to clean the data after sourcing it. We learnt about Univariate analysis and Bivariate analysis and how such analysis helps in deriving useful concepts from the data. We also learnt how to derive new metrics from the given data to make our insights more useful and meaningful.
